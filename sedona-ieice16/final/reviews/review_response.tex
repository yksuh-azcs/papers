The manuscript is well revised.

However, I have a question how to estimate each daemon's influence as time.
The estimation is important for accuracy of your proposed method.

For acceptance, please clarify the estimation method and its validity.

}

If I understood your question right, 
each daemon's influence is translated to its respective cutoff, which I proposed and derived in this paper. 
For the detailed cutoffs, please refer to Tab.~1 and for computation process (estimation method in your term), the second paragraph in the right column on page~3.
As mentioned in the paper, the cutoffs are used to drop any execution (sample) involving daemon executions 
over their respective cutoffs. This drop indicates that such an execution was *significantly influenced* by infrequent, long-running daemons and thus we cannot include 
that execution in the computation of the execution time of a given program.

To assess the validity of my protocol using the cutoffs, I used the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite and observed that the protocol 
outperformed the extant method using elapsed time, as exhibited in Tab.~3 on page~4 (as already indicated by the previous revision). 
Note also that I took out Fig.~1 and instead moved Fig.~5 in the former revision (now Fig.~1) upfront (on page~1) in this revision, 
to early draw the attention of the protocol's effectiveness on two real programs (insertion sort and matrix multiplication) with increasing workloads.

Last but not least, there seems a confusion from the used program-under-test (PUT) (e.g., PUT128 and PUT16384) 
for not only defining but also evaluating the protocol. (In fact, the PUT is also an arbitrary \hbox{compute-bound} program, 
so there's no problem with applying the protocol to that. But I acknowledge that the dual use of the PUT potentially confuses readers including you.)
To unravel the confusion, I have redesigned the protocol, divided into the three major steps, as shown in Fig.~2 on page~2. 
In the new design, I talk about the PUT, only in the context of protocol definition (Step~B), but do not use it for evaluation. 
As described above, the evaluation was performed on those two real-world programs and the SPEC CPU benchmarks.

Many thanks for your great comments.
