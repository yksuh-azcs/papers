subject:	 the new figure 1 in the subopt paper

Rick,

I managed to find a good example in redrawing figure 1 in the subopt
paper. The data concerns a query executed on PostgreSQL.

In op-1M-100q-6, we have

Query Number 13: SELECT t0.id1, t0.id2, t2.id4, t1.id1 FROM ft_HT3 t2,
ft_HT2 t1, ft_HT1 t0 WHERE (t2.id4=t1.id1 AND t1.id1=t0.id1).

Its Q@C data are shown below.

      CARD     PLANID    MED_CQT
---------- ---------- ----------
   2000000 -7.805E+18     4976.5
   1840000 -7.805E+18     4589.5
   1830000 9.0971E+18     4902.1
   1650000 9.0971E+18     4548.9
   1640000 -7.805E+18     4482.1
   1450000 -7.805E+18     4050.9
   1440000 9.0971E+18     4582.5
    930000 9.0971E+18     3590.2
    920000 -9.166E+18     3534.7
    830000 -9.166E+18     3636.5
    820000 -7.805E+18     3480.1
    730000 -7.805E+18     3220.1
    720000 -9.166E+18     3437.6
     50000 -9.166E+18             1436.7
     40000 4.3031E+18     1318.7

The attached renders the change points and their respective Q@C times,
as discussed at our last meeting. Please let me know if the query and
data are fine with you.
Then, I'll update the description and the figure.

Sincerely,

Young
