[Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author]:
Reviewer: 1

Comments to the Author
Generally Fig1. is not a figure scale and can be considered as a structure rather aha a Fig. 1. technically, the primary figures are the general scale and structure of the method which tends to grasp the authors' attention and must be clarified. 
}

\rev{
The presented Wizard Architecture in Fig. 2 needs to be expanded. 
}

\rev{
The table in Page3 does not have any caption to introduces besides, its location is badly organized.
}
The table is now denoted as Table~1 with its corresponding caption provided. We also placed it at the top of page~3, which looks the best location for that.

\rev{
The main contribution of the paper is so limited and needs to be extended in Section 1. 
} 

\rev{ 
In the experiment environmental setting, the deployment in realistic datasets are missing and must be indicated for the reproduction of the future readers.  
}
 
\rev{
According to the bar-shaped results, the WIZARD does not provide optimal results compared to the state-of the arts. They must clearly be expressed how this cases can be used in the real-time scenarios. 
}

\rev{
Also, Authors should give a more clear definition of the "application type" used in the paper. For example, what information of applications are used and how to obtain this information. 
}

\rev{
Last but not least backs to the background which is limited and some hot-related works are missing that are listed in i)"Using imperialist competition algorithm for independent task scheduling in grid computing" and ii) "A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for Job scheduling on computational grids" that addressed the analytical workload exploitation in the real case studies that must be added in the background to make your work holistic for the future readers.
}
We now have some mentions of the above two works compared to our work. Also, we added these two in the references of the revised manuscript.

Reviewing: 2

Comments to the Author
The paper could be published after addressing following comments:
1. Abstract could be better write, in this reviewer point of view, the current abstract is not comprehensive.
}
 
\rev{
2. The manuscript could be better organize as well. For instance, the related works section could be placed after introduction section no before conclusion.
}
A great suggestion. We have relocated the related work right after the introduction in the revision. Note that there are some references added in the related work for completeness.


\rev{
3. Providing a comparison table could be useful for readers.
}

\rev{
4. Conclusion is too long.
}

\rev{
5. Introduction section need more references.
}
